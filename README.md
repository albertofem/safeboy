safeboy is a GameBoy (8bit, black and white) emulator made in Rust. It's based mainly on RBoy implementation (https://github.com/mvdnes/rboy).

# Learning purposes

This emulator is made for learning purposes. With that I mind:

* I documented as much as I can all complicated hardware instructions and other parts of the core (MMU, GPU, etc.)
* I try to have as many as test cases as possible (WIP!)
* Variable names are not abbreviated like it's usual in emulators, so it's more understandable

# Supported features

* MBC1
* Timer

# TODO

* Rest of MBCs
* Sound
* Serial Port
* Accuracy
